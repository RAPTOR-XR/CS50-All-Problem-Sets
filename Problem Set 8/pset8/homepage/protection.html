            The first step in chess improvement is learning how to keep an eye on your pieces and make sure you aren't just leaving them were the opponent can capture them at no cost. If your opponent attacks one of your pieces, don't just ignore it, do something about it! Letting your opponent take all your pieces is one sure way to lose a game of chess. <br>

            Protection: <br>
            Protection is a basic and very important concept in chess. What does it mean when we say a piece is protected? It simply means that, if our opponent captures one of our pieces, then we can capture our opponent's piece in return.
